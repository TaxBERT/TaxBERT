    "The DataCollatorForLanguageModeling is imported from the Hugging Face transformers library and is designed to dynamically apply masking to tokens within input sequences during the training process.\n",
    "By applying masks dynamically, the data collator ensures that the model is continuously exposed to new masking patterns in each epoch.\n",
    "We configure the data collator with the previously initialized tokenizer, ensuring that the tokenization scheme remains consistent throughout the preprocessing pipeline.\n",
    "The parameter mlm=True specifies that the collator will prepare data for masked language modeling.\n",
    "Note: You can also configure the mlm_probability parameter. A value of, for example, 0.10 indicates that 10% of the tokens in each input sequence will be randomly masked during training.\n",
    "Second, we load a pretrained transformer model and customize it for a masked language modeling (MLM) task.\n",
    "We begin by importing **RobertaConfig** and **RobertaForMaskedLM** from the Hugging Face transformers library.\n",
    "For many researchers, especially those in academic or smaller institutional settings, computational resources are limited and expensive to acquire.\n",
    "In line with Webersinke et al. [2022], we therefore recommend using **DistilRoBERTa** as the starting point for training.\n",
    "It is a distilled version of RoBERTa, which itself is an optimized version of the BERT model, enhancing performance across various NLP tasks.\n",
    "Thus, the RobertaConfig object is initialized using the configuration of DistilRoBERTa.\n",
    "To better adapt the model to the specific dataset and potentially address overfitting issues, we recommend modifying key hyperparameters within this configuration.\n",
    "Both the **hidden_dropout_prob** and **attention_probs_dropout_prob** can be increased (the default is 0.1; in this case, for example, they are increased to 0.3).\n",
    "The hidden dropout affects the feedforward layers of the model, while the attention dropout applies to the attention mechanisms that allow the model to focus on different parts of the input text.\n",
    "By increasing these dropout rates, the model is regularized more aggressively, which helps prevent overfitting. Overfitting is a common issue when fine-tuning on smaller or highly specialized datasets, such as those used in accounting and taxation research.\n",
    "We also recommend increasing these rates when dealing with repetitive language and limited variation, which might cause the model to memorize patterns rather than generalize effectively.\n",
    "The example script then loads the pretrained DistilRoBERTa model with the modified configuration. Next, the model's token embeddings are **resized** using model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer)).\n",
    "This step is crucial because the tokenizer was previously expanded to include new, domain-specific tokens not present in the original vocabulary.\n",
    "Finally, the model is moved to the specified GPU using model.to(device). This ensures that subsequent training steps leverage the available **GPU** resources for optimal performance.\n",
    "This stage sets the foundation for adapting a general-purpose language model to domain-specific texts."

    "A sufficient number of epochs allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships within the domain-specific corpus.\n",
    "However, too many epochs can lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data instead of generalizing well to unseen data.\n",
    "For domain-adaptive pretraining, the number of epochs is typically set between three and 20, depending on the dataset’s size and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the effective **batch size** specifies the total number of training samples used collectively to update the model’s parameters.\n",
    "There is a trade-off when selecting a batch size: larger batch sizes improve computational efficiency and provide smoother gradient updates but require more memory, whereas smaller batch sizes introduce more noise into updates, which can sometimes enhance generalization but slow down convergence.\n",
    "The effective batch size is determined by the batch size per device and gradient accumulation, a technique that accumulates gradients over multiple steps before updating the model.\n",
    "This approach simulates a larger batch size, stabilizing training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up data loading, dataloader_num_workers is set to 32, leveraging multiprocessing to fetch training samples in parallel. This is particularly beneficial when working with large datasets.\n",
    "Mixed-precision training (fp16=True) is enabled, allowing the model to use lower-precision floating-point arithmetic. This significantly accelerates computations on GPUs while reducing memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the **learning rate** controls the step size at which the model updates its parameters (weights) during training in response to computed gradients.\n",
    "It determines how quickly the model learns from the data. Choosing the optimal learning rate is challenging:\n",
    "if it is too low, the model takes very small steps, resulting in slow training.\n",
    "If it is too high, the model may take excessively large steps, potentially overshooting the optimal point in the loss function, which measures the difference between the model’s predictions and the true labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, setting the **random seed** to 42 ensures **reproducibility**, making it possible to obtain consistent results when re-running the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We further recommend performing a **grid-search** on the ranges ϵ {2e-4, 2e-5, 3e-4, 3e-5, 4e-4, 4e-5, 5e-4, 5e-5} for learning rate and ϵ {8, 16, 32, 64} for batch size.\n",
    "This hyperparameter tuning method systematically explores different values for these parameters, identifying the combination that yields the best performance.\n"
